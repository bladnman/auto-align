## Releases

### 0.0.9
* Added example screenshot
* Added '[' to line skip defaults

### 0.0.8
* Added ability to skip lines that end in certain patterns. This is most useful to me in something like CSS or JSON where I don't want the block-assignment to be aligned, but 
I do for the rules.

### 0.0.6
* Fixed an issue where if a line had more than 1 moveable item it would move the first, but replace it with the last. Ugly.
* Added changelog

### 0.0.5
* Fixed an issue where very short lines were not aligning quite right

### 0.0.4
* Big improvements around customization. Also will now re-align already aligned areas.

### 0.0.1
* Initial release
